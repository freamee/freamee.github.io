## Basic

**IMPORTANT!**<br/>
This script is not creating tables for the client, this uses **World Objects** with the **GetClosestObjectOfType** native!

The script is already set up for the default GTA:O Casino, so you will not have to mess with the Config.Pokers tables.<br/>
If you are using custom map for your casino, then go near the Poker Tables and type the **/getpokertable** command, and in your client console there will be a result, you will need to add it in your **Config.Pokers** lua table.

:::caution
This resource is standalone, so it is not linked to any framework, comes from that you will need to adjust some functions to fit your server, explanations below.

Common issues / Frequently asked questions.

## The networked players are rotated around the ball.
This is an error which we could not fix, they are rotated because of the ball rotation after the hit.

We tried to change the ball's rotation when 'entering' into the aiming mode, but still buggy.

No idea, how could we make it work with our resource, because we are attaching the player to the ball, doing it differently makes the whole script stop functioning.
